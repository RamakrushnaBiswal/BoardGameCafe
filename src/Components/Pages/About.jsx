            How it works.. Our name says it all! Founder, Jonathan Li, shares a
            passion for board games, boba, and delicious food, so he combined
            them all to become Sip & Play, Park Slopeâ€™s first board game cafe.
            It is a straightforward concept, come in with your friends and
            family to play any board game from our library of{" "}
            <span className="">300+ games!</span>
            We hope when you visit, you also enjoy our coffee, espresso, boba,
            sandwiches, and snacks!
